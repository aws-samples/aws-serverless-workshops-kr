        Wild Rydes has a dedicated staff that recruits, trains, and tends to our herd of unicorns. We take great pride in the quality of unicorns and rydes that we provide to our customers, and our staff exercises the utmost care in vetting the unicorns that join our herd.

      <p className="content">
        Every unicorn goes through a rigorous due diligence process where we perform background checks, flying exams, and several rounds of interviews. Unicorns accepted to Wild Rydes are then treated to the best care and maintenance possible. We provide them excellent benefits, health care, and employee perks. This is part of our company philosophy in which happy unicorns lead to happy customers.
